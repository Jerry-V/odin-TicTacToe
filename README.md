# odin-TicTacToe
An assignment from The Odin Project where you create a Tic Tac Toe game utilizing minimal global code. This is done by utilizing scope-limiting objects, modules, factory-functions and so forth. This iteration implements the optional addition of an AI opponent utilizing the [Minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax).

#### Assignment: [Project: Tic Tac Toe](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe)

### My Experience:
* This project forced me to become more familiar and comfortable with using modules, functions, and objects in general.
* My code became more modular and flexible by chunking what I needed into modules and hidden sub-functions.
* I became more comfortable manipulating event listeners and interacting with the DOM.
* Watching several youtube videos on the **Minimax** algorithm gave me ideas how to implement it in a more flexible and scalable manner in the future (noted in my code's minimax comments).
* My first time in javascript implementing a recursion-based algorithm. __MUCH__ more pleasant than my first experience within esoteric [ACL2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACL2) at Univeristy (everything is done by recursion in that language... EVERYTHING... ***"shudders"***).

#### Final Notes:
I encountered problems but through perseverance I overcame them. This whole project also reinforces what I have heard and experienced... projects will almost ALWAYS take longer than you think it will. Eh... at least I learned something.
